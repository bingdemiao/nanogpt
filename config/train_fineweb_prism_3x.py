"""GPT-2 small (124M) with prism-3× MLPs on FineWeb-Edu sample-10BT.

Step-6 param-matched ablation at GPT-2 scale. At d=768, gs=64, r=8:
  vanilla 4× MLP : 56.62 M params
  prism   3× MLP : 45.30 M params   (-20.0% MLP, -9.1% total)

If the TinyStories LR sweep (Step 5) shows prism-3× tying vanilla-4× at
fixed recipe, this run confirms the result survives the jump to a
real-language dataset and a 2.5x larger model.

Wallclock: ~17-20 hours on 4x GH200 (bf16, 100k iters at ~700 ms/iter).
